<h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: red"><i>Background</i></h2>

<p>Hey everyone, my name is Noah Rosenbaum. I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas. I lived there until high school was over, and then I moved to San Antonio to go to college.
    <br>Once college ended, I went to nursing school at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. However, after a semsester of school, I realized I didn't enjoy it. I withdrew, and have been trying to find what I want to do since then. 
    <br>I know web development is a great route to go down, so I wanted to try it.
</p>



<h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: navy;"><i>Hobbies</i></h2>

<p>Some of my hobbies include working out, watching and playing sports, hanging out with friends, and learning new things. My favorite sports are baseball, basketball, and MMA.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: red;"><i>Why?</i></h2>

<p>I wanted to become a developer because it seems like one of the better options for a career in the world we live in today. You can make enough money to live comfortably, job growth is high, and working from home will be nice as well.</p>
